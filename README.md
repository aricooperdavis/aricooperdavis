## Hi, I'm Ari ðŸ˜€

I'm a geospatial data scientist and software developer with a PhD in water informatics engineering, specialising in machine learning techniques for urban drainage forecasting. I am lucky to have a wealth of experience working with industry leaders in urban water solutions, such as Veolia and DHI, in the research and development of tools and technologies for improving network performance and resilience.

When not at work, you'll often find me outside - either underground as a keen caver and mine explorer, on the hills with my dog, or surfing on the gorgeous North Cornwall coast. I put my love of the outdoors to good use by volunteering for a couple of search and rescue teams; Devon Cave Rescue Organisation and West Cornwall Search and Rescue Team, who help people in distress in inaccessible locations in the South West of England.

__Get in touch!__ You can find me as `@aricooperdavis` on most platforms, and my website is [cooper-davis.net](https://cooper-davis.net)
